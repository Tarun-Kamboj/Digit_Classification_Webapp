## Intro

In this webapp, user can draw any digit (from 0 to 9) and the application will try to predict the digit drawn by user. It uses React for the drawing purpose and Django st the back-end.

## Working 

The digit drawn by the user is turned into an image, which is then resized and fed into a neural network made using Keras. The neural network predicts the digit and returns the result to the front-end.

## Usage

| 1. Draw any digit and click `Predict` button. | ![Image not found](/Readme_Images/2.png) |
